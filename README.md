*An image squisher*

Crushee is an image compression tool, powered by Electron and Node.js. It accepts JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, and WebP files, and will output to JPEG, PNG, or WebP. It's useful for batch optimization and resizing images. You can carefully tune your images to meet your needs without having to re-upload or restart every time.

Crushee was primarily built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/), and [compress-images](https://github.com/semiromid/compress-images).



## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v10+)

- **libjpeg** (Actual library depends on your OS)

- What what I've experienced, all other image libraries should come pre-built through *npm install*



## Usage

- Download or clone
- If you're using the git CLI, run *git submodule update --init* to set up the crushee-server submodule.
- Run *npm install* in both the root folder and *crushee-server*.
- If you're missing any image libraries (depending on your OS), get those and re-run *npm install* as needed.
- Include the Node binary for your OS to the *crushee-server* directory.
- Run *npm start*.
